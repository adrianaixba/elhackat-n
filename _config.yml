  about:
    description: >
      El Hackatón is a hackathon hosted at The University of Texas at Austin.
      The purpose of our event is to break cultural stereotypes as well as empower 
      one of the most important demographics in our country, and sadly one of the least 
      recognized in the Tech industry. Do not misunderstand the concept; we are happy to include 
      people of all backgrounds in the event but have the mission to bring a hackathon opportunity 
      to students who might not usually attend these events, by creating a familiar environment.

  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "Who are we?"

        Our team, Los Hackers, is a focused diverse group of 13 University Of Texas Computer 
        Science students. Our intention is to create a hackaton, El Hackatón, to give people in our
        community the opportunity to have unique empowering experience. Our goal is to provide
        Hispanic members of our community, tools to gain experience working in technology. We
        want to do this by giving them a safe space, so they are able to express themselves,
        collaborate, and learn through innovative thinking. We want to provide participants with
        tech talks, skill building workshops, and the tech instruments to supply the innovative ideas
        of novices and experienced hackers.
